# Glow
This is pytorch implementation of paper "Glow: Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions". Most modules are adapted from the offical TensorFlow version [openai/glow](https://github.com/openai/glow).

# In training
Currently, I am training the model with [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and `hparams.json`
